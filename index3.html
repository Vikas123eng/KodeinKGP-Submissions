<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>If you are unable to see the title of your HTML document in the browser's title bar or tab when viewing the page in Google Chrome, there could be a few reasons for this:

1. The code you provided is correct, but you might not have saved the HTML file with the correct extension. Ensure that the file has a ".html" extension. For example, "index.html".

2. It's possible that you have multiple open tabs or windows in your browser, and the title of your HTML document might be hidden due to limited space. You can try minimizing other tabs or rearranging them to see if the title becomes visible.

3. If you are viewing the HTML file locally (i.e., opening the file directly from your computer's file system), some browsers, including Google Chrome, may restrict certain functionalities due to security reasons. This security restriction is known as the "Same-Origin Policy." To bypass this, you can try hosting the HTML file on a web server (locally or remotely) and access it through the server's URL (e.g., http://localhost/index.html).

4. Clearing the cache and reloading the page can also help in some cases. Pressing Ctrl + Shift + R (or Command + Shift + R on Mac) performs a hard refresh, forcing the browser to reload the page and its associated resources.

If none of these solutions work, it's possible that there may be an issue with your specific browser settings or configuration. In that case, you may want to try opening the HTML file in a different browser or consult relevant browser documentation or support forums for further assistance.
