            <p>In this video I will cram as much as possible about CSS. We will be looking at styles, selectors, declarations, etc. We will build a CSS cheat sheet that you can keep as a resource and we will also create a basic website layout. We are using CSS3 but mostly the basics. I will be creating an advanced CSS course with animations,</p>
